            <p>Hello.  My name is __________. I am working with [NAME OF ORGANIZATION].  We are conducting a survey about health and other topics all over [NAME OF COUNTRY]. The information we collect will help the government to plan health services. Your household was selected for the survey. I would like to ask you some questions about your household.

You don't have to be in the survey, but we hope you will agree to answer the questions since your views are important. If I ask you any question you don't want to answer, just let me know and I will go on to the next question or you can stop the interview at any time. In case you need more information about the survey, you may contact the person listed on this card.</p>
