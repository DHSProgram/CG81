To be checked for cervical cancer, a woman is asked to lie on her back with her legs apart. Then the healthcare worker will use a brush or swab to collect a sample from inside her. The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing. This test is called a Pap smear or HPV test. Another method is called a VIA or Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid. In this test, the healthcare worker puts vinegar on the cervix to see if there is a reaction.</p>

            <p>ACHD26. Now I’m going to ask you about tests a healthcare worker can do to check for cervical cancer, which is cancer in the cervix. The cervix connects the womb to the vagina. To be checked for cervical cancer, a woman is asked to lie on her back with her legs apart. Then the healthcare worker will use a brush or swab to collect a sample from inside her. The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing. This test is called a Pap smear or HPV test. Another method is called a VIA or Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid. In this test, the healthcare worker puts vinegar on the cervix to see if there is a reaction.</p><p>Z_CHD27. Has a doctor or other healthcare worker ever tested you for cervical cancer?<br></p></p></p></p>
